# Introduction

This document outlines some of the very basics of the Cross-Linguistic Data Format (CLDF) for researchers who want to use the data sets for analysis, comparison or plotting. The title of the document is a reference to the "... for dummies" book series of non-intimidating guides to various topics. It is not meant as an insult in anyway.

CLDF is a way of organizing language data, in particular data sets with many different languages in it. The basic organisation is a set of tables, usually in csv-sheets (`languages.csv`, `forms.csv` etc). These documents are linked to each other in a specific way which makes it possible to combine them into an interlinked database. The files are governed by standards, there are sanity-checks to make sure everything lines up right (every language has a row in the LanguageTable etc). Because CLDF-datasets are often just plain csv-sheets they can easily be read in by most data analysis software programs like Python, R, Julia etc or just regular spreadsheet programs like LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel. It is not necessary to use FileMakerPro, Microsoft Access or similar programs.

CLDF is plain, flat and simpler than you might think. In this document, you will learn the very basics on how the content structure works.

The data format was first published in 2018 [1] and has since then been used in a large amount of different datasets. You can see a list of them [here](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/clld_meta/blob/master/cldf/contributions.csv).

CLDF is well-documented. This document is a very basic intro, for more advanced queries go to <https://github.com/cldf/cldf/#readme> and <https://cldf.clld.org/>. We'll link to the CLDF-spec documents throughout this document as needed.

## Expectations of reader
This document is written for an audience interested in systematic documentation of cross-linguistic data and who have basic familiarity with using columns and rows in tables to represent information. There are extra pointers in some places for code using the python package `pandas` or the R package `dplyr`, but it is not necessary to master these programming languages or specific packages to make use of this document. 

## What is NOT in this document
This document is an overview of the content and structure of CLDF-datasets. It does not contain a tutorial for how to _create_ CLDF-datasets. For tutorials on creation of CLDF-datasets and other use cases, see [the CLDF-cookbooks](https://github.com/cldf/cookbook/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

# Glossary
In CLDF, there are some specific terms that are good to know about.

- **publication**: top-level unit, can be linked to multiple modules
- **module/dataset**: set of CLDF-components linked in a structured way. Modules come in different types, for example `WordList` or `Generic` [CLDF-spec: Modules](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/blob/master/modules/README.md)
- **component**: table which conforms to specific CLDF-rules. The component "LanguageTable" is often found in a file called "languages.csv". All CLDF components (including their default metadata) are listed at [CLDF-spec: Components](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/components). Examples include:
    - LanguageTable
    - ParameterTable
    - FormTable
    - etc.
- **property**: column in a table. The property `languageReference` is often realised in a column called `Language_ID`. All CLDF properties are listed in the [CLDF ontology](https://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.html).

For example, within the publication WALS is linked to a CLDF-dataset of the module-type `StructureDataset`. Inside this module are a set of tables (a.k.a. `components`). Each table contains columns which track `properties` of the data.

# How to know if you’re dealing with a CLDF-dataset

You are dealing with a CLDF-data set if there is a file ending with the extension `.json` and at the top inside of it it identifies a CLDF-dataset type. For
example, it could be `dc:conformsTo: http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#StructureDataset`. (There is one exception to this rule, see “Good to know” below.)

Often there is a folder called “cldf” with files like `languages.csv`, `values.csv` and `StructureDataset-metadata.json` in it. The JSON filename will be different depending on the type of module.

Here are some examples of data sets that are available in CLDF that you may have encountered:

-   WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures)

-   PHOIBLE (Phonetics Information Base and Lexicon)

-   D-PLACE (Database of Places, Language, Culture and Environment)

-   Glottolog

-   Lexibank 

-   Grambank

-   AUTOTYP

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: [It is possible for a CLDF-dataset to only consist of one file](https://github.com/cldf/cldf#metadata-free-conformance)! No JSON-file, no set of csvs. Just one file, for example `values.csv`. In such cases, the file doesn’t have any meta-data specified and just conforms to all the default settings for all components, properties etc. You can’t tell by a JSON-file that it’s a CLDF-dataset because there isn’t one This type of CLDF-data set is rare, and will not be dealt with further here.

# Types of CLDF-modules

There are six types of CLDF-[“modules”](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/modules).

-   Wordlist (has Forms and often Cognates)
    - example: lexibank-analysed & Vanuatu Voices
    - [README in CLDF specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/blob/master/modules/Wordlist/README.md)
-   StructureDataset (grammar or other types of information with one value for a Parameter and a Feature, has Values)
    - example: PHOIBLE, glottolog-cldf, WALS, AUTOTYP, D-PLACE & Grambank
    - [README in CLDF specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/blob/master/modules/StructureDataset/README.md)
-   Generic (no specifics)
    - [Phlorest phylogeny derived from Honkola et al. 2013](https://github.com/phlorest/honkola_et_al2013/)
-   Dictionary (particular kind of lexicon, has Entries and Senses)
    - example: [medialengua](https://github.com/dictionaria/medialengua)
    - [README in CLDF specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/blob/master/modules/Dictionary/README.md)
-   TextCorpus (cohesive stretches of discourse in the object language)
    - example: [Tsez Annotated Corpus Project](https://github.com/clld/tsezacp)
-   Parallel text (collections of paragraphs of the same text in different languages, has Forms, Segments and FunctionalEquivalents)
    - [README in CLDF specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/blob/master/modules/ParallelText/README.md)

There is a catalogue of almost all published CLDF-datasets, [`clld_meta`](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/clld_meta). It is itself a CLDF-dataset and contains information all all known CLDF-datasets (excluding itself and glottolog-cldf).

The table below shows the number of modules for each type, in clld_meta on 2024-04-19. Different modules with the same Concept_DOI have been collapsed to one item, this means that for example WALS counts only once even though 5 distinct versions have been published. In most cases, datasets that are versions of the same underlying data have the same Concept_DOI, for example: Grambank has been published in 4 versions but they all share the same Concept_DOI. 

Most CLDF data are word-lists.

| Module  | n    |
|-----|----------|
| Wordlist           |167|
| StructureDataset   | 43|
| Generic            | 31|
| Dictionary         | 17|
| TextCorpus         |  1|
| ParallelText       | 0 |

Publications can be linked to several CLDF-modules, sometimes even of different types. These can be published together or separately on platforms like Zenodo. In clld_meta, the different modules are most often linked by the same Contribution_ID. They can be further linked via Concept_DOI, which would also track different versions. Here are all of the CLDF-contributions in clld_meta which are linked to several modules of different types.

- tsezacp (TextCorpus and Dictionary)
- gerstnerhungarian (Wordlist and Dictionary)
- lexibank-analysed (StructureDataset and Wordlist)
- liljegrenhindukush (StructureDataset and Wordlist)
- zhoubizic (StructureDataset and Wordlist)
- beidasinitic (StructureDataset and Wordlist)      
- allenbai (StructureDataset and Wordlist)          
- mattercariban (StructureDataset and Wordlist)     
- normansinitic (StructureDataset and Wordlist)

# Contents

Each CLDF-dataset (except the metadata-free ones) consists minimally of:

-   a set of tables (usually in csv-sheets, but sometimes tsv or other. The specifics are noted in the metadata JSON-file)
-   a JSON-file

The tables are usually in csv-format and contain the data itself. The JSON-file has information *about* the dataset, for example the type of dataset is, what the contents are, what the filenames are etc.

Many CLDF-datasets also contain a bibTeX-file with bibliographic references for the data. In such cases, each data-point may be tied to a reference by the key in the bibTeX entry. Usually, the key is in a column called “Source” in the ValueTable or FormTable. The bibTeX file is usually called “sources.bib”. If it’s called something else, it’ll say so in the meta-data JSON-file.

In general, the metadata in the JSON-file is helpful to examine as it'll clarify exactly what is where, the formatting, what is linked to what etc. JSON-files can be hard to read for the first time manually, but even if you do not understand all the structures it is usually possible to derive some important key information.

## Tables (a.k.a. components)

There are some tables that occur in most CLDF-modules, and some that occur only in certain types. For example, there is no table with word forms for StructureDatasets - that’s for Wordlists and Dictionaries.

The tables have specific names in the CLDF-world and have pre-defined specifics with options for non-standard columns and information as well. The names are different from their filenames. You can see which name is tied to which file in the json. “LanguageTable” is usually found in the file languages.csv, “CodeTable” in codes.csv, “ValueTable” in values.csv, “CognateTable” in cognates.csv etc.

-   LanguageTable -\> languages.csv (contains minimally ID)
-   FormTable -\> forms.csv (contains minimally ID, Form, Language_ID,
    Parameter_ID)
-   ParameterTable -\> parameters.csv (contains minimally ID, Name) etc.

The JSON-file of metadata contains information on which tables (a.k.a components)  are inside the dataset and in turn what columns (a.k.a properites) the have.  You can see what type of CLDF-component a table is by inspecting the line in the section of the code that contains `dc:conformsTo`, e.g. `dc:conformsTo": 
"http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#ValueTable` means that the component being  described in that section of the code is a ValueTable. Later down in the section 
describing the component, we can find the specific filename in the url-field, e.g. `url": "values.csv`. Now we know there's a ValueTable and it's in the file values.csv.

The specific line in the meta-data JSON file contains the string  Types of tables that have special meaning and rules in CLDF are known as `components`. **You can’t  always bank on LanguageTable being in languages.csv**. SQL, [`pycldf`](https://pypi.org/project/pycldf/0.6.0/) and [`rcldf`](https://github.com/SimonGreenhill/rcldf/releases/tag/v1.2.0) can handle this for you, i.e. look up in the JSON-filewhat component is where and set all that up.

Each type of table contains columns which conform to [CLDF-rules](https://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.html), i.e. properties. For example, FormTables need to have columns for the properties “id”, “form” and “Language_ID” and they in turn need to look a certain way.

Tables can have more columns than the minimal requirement and can have columns that don’t map onto CLDF properties at all.


## Tables in most CLDF-modules

Here are CLDF-tables that occur in most CLDF-modules.

-   LanguageTable - list of all of the languages in the dataset. May also include language varities classified by Glottolog as dialects or proto-languages. Includes meta-information like longitude, language, family etc.
-   ParameterTable - contains a definition of the variables. For lexicon, these are the concepts (e.g. "hand"), for grammar these are the features (e.g. "Definite articles").

Wordlist also contain

-   FormTable - the forms for each concept for each language
-   CognateTable (not obligatory) - the cognate classification per form per concept per language

Structure data-sets also contain

-   ValueTable - the value for each parameter and language. Usually also Comment and Source.
-   CodeTable - The list of possible values for each parameter. For example, GB020 in Grambank is a binary feature and can take 0, 1 and ? whereas EA016 in the Ethnographic Atlas (D-PLACE) can take 1, 2 or 9. The options are often exclusive of each other for each language. There are examples of languages that are coded for more than one value, usually with extra information on proportions.

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: while there are minimal required content depending on module type, there is also flexibility in adding more information. Some modules contain components that typically appear in different modules. E.g. the tsezacp morpheme concordance is modeled using an `EntryTable` component, despite the dataset being a `TextCorpus` and not a `Dictionary` (where we usually find `EntryTables`).

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: CLDF can be used for data on socities or other units of observation - not just languages. For example, in the CLDF-dataset of D-PLACE (v1 and v2), the LanguageTable contains a row per *society* - not per language. There is a column for the Glottocode of the language associated with that society.

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: Wordlist modules typically contain information on how the words are linked to items in the [Concepticon resource](https://concepticon.clld.org/). This resource serves to help link the same or similar concepts in different word lists (e.g. "SEA" and "OCEAN"). It is encouraged that new Wordlists modules link to Concepticon, but it is not a necessary requirement for publishing CLDF Wordlist modules.

## Columns (a.k.a properties) in tables

Each table consists of a set of columns. The names of these columns are often for example "ID", "Longitude", "Value" etc. However, they can vary. The meta-data contains information on which column name maps onto what property in the CLDF-universe. For example, there is the property "source"", which has the propertyURL <http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#source> and often is mapped onto a column called "Source". However, if one CLDF-creator wanted to name this column "Reference" instead, that's all well and good. The JSON metadata-file would tell the users that the column "Reference" corresponds to the standardised property "source" and point to the property-url. As with filenames of tables, you can often get by with assuming that bibliographic references are in a column called "Source" and the LanguageTable is in languages.csv --- but this needn't always be true! Studying the JSON meta-data file is often worthwhile.

# Example: Wordlist

Below is a tiny Wordlist CLDF-module. This module contains 3 words in 2 languages. The first two tables, LanguageTable and ParameterTable contain information about the languages and parameters - in this case concepts. The FormTable contains the actual forms. For one of the concepts, one of the languages has two words and both are listed.

The meta-data JSON-file is not included here. You can see an example of a Wordlist-metadata JSON-file [here](https://github.com/lexibank/abvd/blob/master/cldf/cldf-metadata.json).

**LanguageTable**

One row = one language (or sometimes dialect or proto-language, i.e above language in a tree). The ID column uniquely identifies each language in the dataset. In other tables, the column that links to the ID column here is called “Language_ID”.

| ID  | Name     | Glottocode |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 15  | Bintulu  | bint1246   |
| 18  | Chamorro | cham1312   |

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: Sometimes the IDs in LanguageTable are [Glottocodes (curated by Glottolog)](https://glottolog.org/glottolog/language) or [ISO 639-3 codes (curated by SIL International)](https://iso639-3.sil.org/), but they don’t have to be. They just have to be unique within that dataset. In Grambank, the IDs are Glottocodes, but WALS has its own specific unique code-system different from both Glottocodes and ISO 639-3. If you want Glottocodes, go look for a column called Glottocode in the LanguageTable - don’t use the ID column.

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: Glottocodes contain 4 letters or numbers and then 4 numbers. The first 4 characters are not always letters. For example, `ww2p1234` and `3adt1234` are existing glottocodes.

**ParameterTable**

One row = one parameter. The ID column uniquely identifies each parameter in the dataset. In other tables, the column that links to the ID column here is called “Parameter_ID”.

| ID         | Name    | Concepticon_ID |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 144_toburn | to burn | 2102           |
| 2_left     | left    | 244            |

**FormTable**

One row = one form. The ID column uniquely identifies each form in the dataset. In other tables, the column that links to the ID column here is called “Form_ID”. Here we also see Parameter_ID, which links to the column ID in the ParameterTable and Language_ID which links to the column ID in the LanguageTable.

| ID              | Parameter_ID | Language_ID | Form   | Source        |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 15-144_toburn-1 | 144_toburn   | 15          | pegew  | Blust-15-2005 |
| 15-144_toburn-2 | 144_toburn   | 15          | tinew  | Blust-15-2005 |
| 18-2_left-1     | 2_left       | 18          | akague | 38174         |

In this example, and in several other WordList datasets (but not all), the ID column is in fact a combination of the Language_ID, Parameter_ID and last a number to distinguish if there are more than one form. For example, because Bintulu has two words for “to burn”, there are two rows with different Forms but the same Parameter_ID (they both mean “to burn”). The ID column, which identifies each form has a number at the end of the string which indicates the different form. If there is only one form, the string ends with “-1”, but as you can see for “to burn” it first has “-1” and then “-2”.

**Source**

Optional file, but often present in the form of a bibTeX-file. One entry = one source. The bibTeX file is usually called “sources.bib”, but not necessary (check `metadata.json` as usual). The bibTeX Key (the first string after `@BIBTEXENTRYTYPE{`) maps onto the Source column in the FormTable above.

```         
@misc{Blust-15-2005,
    author = {Blust},
    date = {2005},
    howpublished = {personal communication}
}

@book{38174,
    author = {Topping, Donald M. and Ogo, Pedro M. and Dungca, Bernadita C.},
    address = {Honolulu},
    publisher = {The University Press of Hawaii},
    title = {Chamorro-English dictionary},
    year = {1975}
}
```

## example: Wordlist - linking together

Now let's turn to joining information from multiple tables into one. The  information in the different tables are linked to each other via what is called primary and foreign keys. The primary key in a table is found in the column ID and uniquely identifies each row. In a FormTable, it identifies each form, in a ParameterTable, each parameter and so on. There are also foreign keys, these are links to rows in other tables.  For example, in the FormTable in our example there is a column called "Parameter_ID", which is linking the information it rows in the ParameterTable. Generally, most CLDF-dataset tables follow the naming column convention "ID in FormTable = Form_ID in other tables".

| Foreign key  | Primary key    | 
|------------|---------|
|`Langugage_ID` in other tables |`ID` column in LanguageTable |
|`Parameter_ID` in other tables |`ID` column in ParameterTable |
|`Form_ID`  in other tables |`ID` column in FormTable|

These primary and foreign keys make it easy to combine information from many different tables.

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: primary and foreign key are a general infrastructure in relational databases, i.e. also outside of CLDF. They can be labeled with different column/property names depending on wether they are primary or foreign, as in the case of CLDF (`Language_ID`and ÌD`), but they can also have identical labels ([example](https://nceas.github.io/sasap-training/materials/reproducible_research_in_r_fairbanks/data-modeling-tidy-data.html#primary-and-foreign-keys)). Meta-data, like the JSON-file, informs us which is which and what is linked to what.

> [!CAUTION]
> Primary and foreign keys are not the same as keys in dictionaries in python.

Let's list all word forms in our Wordlist with the name of the language they belong to. This requires adding information from LanguageTable for each row in FormTable - we [*join*](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/07-join.html) the information from two tables to create a new table.

We can do this for example in R, using one of [dplyr's `*_join` functions](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/join). Since we want to create a joined table with one row for each row in FormTable, we'll use `left_join` and pass FormTable as first table and LanguageTable as second table. As explained above, the foreign key `Language_ID` in FormTable references the corresponding row in LanguageTable that has information about the language a form belongs to. Thus, for each row in FormTable, we join information from the row in LanguageTable with `ID` matching the `Language_ID` in FormTable. This translates to the following code in R:

```R
library(dplyr)

JoinedTable <- dplyr::left_join(FormTable, LanguageTable, by = c("Language_ID" = "ID"))
```

and the resulting table will look as follows:

| ID         | Parameter_ID | Language_ID | Form      | Source        | Glottocode | Name |
|----------- |-----------   |------------ |---------- |-----------    |----------- |----- |
| 15-144_toburn-1 | 144_toburn   | 15     | pegew     | Blust-15-2005 | bint1246   | Bintulu|
| 15-144_toburn-2 | 144_toburn   | 15     | tinew     | Blust-15-2005 | bint1246   | Bintulu|
| 18-2_left-1     | 2_left       | 18     | akague    | 38174         | cham1312   | Chamorro|



> [!CAUTION]
> Sometimes a LanguageTable contains a column called “Language_ID”, i.e. a key referencing another row in the same table. This is called a "self-referential foreign key". For the glottolog-cldf dataset the column Language_ID in the LanguageTable contains information on the language that a dialect belongs to. For example, Eastern Low Navarrese is a dialect of the language Basque. The glottocode of this dialect is east1470. The glottocode of the language Basque is basq1248. In the LanguageTable of glottolog-cldf the row of the dialect has basq1248 in the column "Language_ID". This helps when you might want to match by the languages rather than the dialect-level. In Grambank, there  is a similar column to glottolog-cldf's "Language_ID", but it is called “Language_level_ID” to make the nature of the relation clearer.

# CLLD, clld and CLDF

CLDF is a type of data-format, the set of tables etc described here. 

CLLD was a larger project and stands for Cross-Linguistic Linked Data. CLLD was a project for publishing databases on the web, it ended in 2016. 

clld is a web app framework - a piece of software. 

clld and CLDF came out of the CLLD-project but are distinct from it. CLDF data interfaces smoothly with clld web applications.

This document is only a very basic intro. If you want to learn more, go
to: 
- [the CLDF specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/#readme)
- [the CLDF website](https://cldf.clld.org/)

For more on _creating_ and _using_ CLDF-datasets, have a look in [these cookbook tutorials](https://github.com/cldf/cookbook/tree/master#readme)

One good way of learning how CLDF works is to poke around in existing datasets. Open the files, check what’s in there, form assumptions and then check if the assumptions are always true (e.g. "are all languages in the ValueTable in the LanguageTable?", "how does Code_ID work in the ValueTable?" etc). Below are two recommended starter-datasets

 -   Wordlist: [NorthEuraLex v4.0](https://github.com/lexibank/northeuralex/tree/v4.0/cldf)
 -   Structure: [Grambank v1.0.3](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/tree/v1.0.3/cldf)
